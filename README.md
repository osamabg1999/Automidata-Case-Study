# TipTrek: Navigating Taxi Tips with Machine Learning

## Background
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that predicts taxi and limousine ride durations based on location and time of day data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

## Problem Statement
You are a data professional in a data analytics firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips, and the ability to filter out people who don't tip would help increase driver revenue.

## Modelling Purpose and Goal
The purpose of this model is to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers. The goal of this model is to predict whether or not a customer is a generous tipper.
